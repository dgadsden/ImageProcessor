HOW TO USE: Image Processor.

There are 3 ways to run the program:

java -jar Program.jar -file path-of-script-file : when invoked in this manner the program should
open the script file, execute it and then shut down.

java -jar Program.jar -text : when invoked in this manner the program should open in an interactive
text mode, allowing the user to type the script and execute it one line at a time.
This is how the program worked in the last assignment.

java -jar Program.jar : when invoked in this manner the program should open the graphical user
interface. This is what will happen if you simply double-click on the jar file.

1. To use the application the user must run the jar file through the command prompt or terminal
or opening the jar file itself, running the main method through the code itself also works.
2. It is then that the user picks in which way they want to use the program
3. If using the GUI the user will apply effects using the buttons the interface provides.
4. The desired image must first be loaded to edit and save properly,
5. If working solely through the command prompt or terminal Then a text file of steps can be entered
or the user can manually submit the commands through the command prompt or terminal.
6.When finished the image can be saved and it will be saved to the user desired path.
7. The user may use the command q or quit to end their session.
